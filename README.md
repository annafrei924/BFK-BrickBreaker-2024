# Brick Breaker
This is a neural network Brick Breaker game in which genetic learning is
used to teach a neural network to play brick breaker by moving the paddle
in such a way that it targets whichever brick is on the screen.



The paddle follows the ball and hits the ball at an angle
aiming toward the brick.
